# Plum Village Knowledgebase

A knowledgebase about Plum Village focusing on its structure, evolution, and ecology of practice rather than its core teachings.

This project explores Plum Village not primarily as a school of mindfulness, but as a living example of a transformative, developmental space. It looks at how Plum Village has evolved as an organizationally and sociologically: its physical and legal structures, economic arrangements, and culture -- across global sites such as France, the U.S., Thailand, and Hong Kong.

It maps the ecology of practices (e.g. “Joyfully Together”), the roles of monastics and lay communities, and affiliated initiatives like Wake Up. A timeline and catalogue of texts will contextualize its evolution.

Finally, there is a [Second Renaissance][] connection: Plum Village is an example of a community creating pioneering pockets of cultural experimentation and transformation in line with the Second Renaissance vision for paradigmatic change.

* Order of Interbeing
* Lay Sanghas worldwide
* Online Sanghas and digital outreach
* Intersections with broader change ecosystems (e.g. climate activism, engaged Buddhism)

### 3. Ecology of Practice

* Core communal practices (e.g. Dharma sharing, sitting meditation, mindful meals, working meditation)
* Named practices and texts (e.g. "Joyfully Together")
* Rhythms of daily life, seasonal retreats, monastic trainings
* Role differentiation: monastics vs lay practitioners
* Developmental pathways: novice → monk/nun → Dharma teacher, etc.

### 4. Texts and Teachings (as contextual reference)

* Annotated catalogue of Thích Nhất Hạnh’s works (optional but valuable)
* Core internal documents (e.g. Five Mindfulness Trainings, Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, Plum Village Charter)

### 5. Sociological and Developmental Framing

* Plum Village as a deliberately developmental space (DDS)
* Cultural norms and governance models (e.g. consensus, councils)
* Limits and potentials of monastic orientation as a model for societal transformation
* Plum Village as a real-world example of Second Renaissance principles:
  * Inner transformation
  * Communal living
  * Cultural experimentation
  * Engagement for paradigmatic change "Engaged Buddhism"
